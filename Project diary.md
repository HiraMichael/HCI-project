# April 19, 2025: Brainstorming first ideas
## Project requirements
- **Goal**: make it smarter and more user-friendly
	- Issues: unclear categorization, privacy
- **Mean**: user-centered design approach
- **Artifact**: design an innovative User Interface
## Idea 1: Derive requirements from interviews and conduct within-person evaluation
### Gathering Insights
- Next step in the human-centered design approach/project: **gather insights**
	- Look for app reviews, scrape, and analyze using some natural language processing methods
	- Interviews
- We prefer interviews over scraping for reviews, because there are no reviews for the gemeinsam.Oldenburg website
- Ideas on how to proceed with interviews
	- Instruct our friends to use the website/tool for 1-2 weeks
	- Later conduct an interview to gather their feedback (e.g., using qualitative content analysis)
	- While they use the tool, we can design the guided interview
	- Aim: 2-3 interviewees
### Evaluation
	- Perhaps, add some sort of questionnaire: We could use it to conduct a within-person comparison of the original tool to our improved tool.

## Idea 2: Derive requirements from existing knowledge and conduct (between-person) evaluation
### Gathering insights
- Are the issues mentioned in the slide part of existing knowledge? -> Ask Dennis (perhaps, using an expert interview)
- Scraping app store reviews of other apps and derive user requirements on that basis
- Or, if categories are an issue, scrape complaints on gemeinsam.Oldenburg site, use e.g., a topic model and derive new categories on that basis
### Evaluation
- Based on our requirements, we can design mockups
- These could also be suitable for A/B testing or, perhaps more advanced, conjoined experiments or factorial survey designs
## Our thoughts
- We are leaning towards idea 2, as it easier to realize within the time frame of the course
## Presentation
- Main points of the project
- Present idea 2
## TODOs
- Michael: prepare two slides
- Michael: send mail with availability (Wednesday, 2pm or afterwards, preferably online)
