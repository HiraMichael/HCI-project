# April 19, 2025: Brainstorming first ideas
## Project requirements
- **Goal**: make it smarter and more user-friendly
	- Issues: unclear categorization, privacy
- **Mean**: user-centered design approach
- **Artifact**: design an innovative User Interface
## Our ideas
- Next step in the human-centered design approach/project: **gather insights**
	- Look for app reviews, scrape, and analyze using some natural language processing methods
	- Interviews
- We prefer interviews over scraping for reviews, because there are no reviews for the gemeinsam.Oldenburg website
- Ideas on how to proceed with interviews
	- Instruct our friends to use the website/tool for 1-2 weeks
	- Later conduct an interview to gather their feedback (e.g., using qualitative content analysis)
	- While they use the tool, we can design the guided interview
	- Aim: 2-3 interviewees
	- Perhaps, add some sort of questionnaire: We could use it to conduct a within-person comparison of the original tool to our improved tool.
